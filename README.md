# Ursus Week 4 Live Session

Welcome to Week 4 where we explore JavaScript functions. We went over functions and how to use them in our code and the benefits that they give us.

**JavaScript Topics:**

1. using `function`s
    1. function declaration - much like a variable declaration this is where we inform JS that there is a function we are going to use
    1. parameters (a.k.a. params) - defining values that will be passed to the function when called
    1. arguments - the values that are passed to a function when the function is called, `doSomething('clean')`
    1. `return` - allows a function to give a return some kind of value when a function  is called
1. difference between a function declaration, `function doAllThings() {}`, and a function call, `doAllThings()`.
1. hoisting
1. scope
